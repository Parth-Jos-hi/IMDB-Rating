üìÅ Project: MovieMaster EDA ‚Äì Movie Ratings and User Behavior Analysis
üìÖ Dataset Version: 35,000 rows
üìä File: MovieMaster_EDA_Full_35k.xlsx

---------------------------------
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
---------------------------------
This project explores the MovieMaster dataset, a simulated version of a large movie ratings dataset similar to MovieLens or IMDB.
The goal is to perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in user behavior, movie preferences, rating trends,
genre popularity, and biases related to demographics or time.

Objectives:
- Analyze relationships between movies, users, and ratings
- Identify data imbalance and cold-start issues
- Explore genre- and year-based rating patterns
- Examine correlations such as recency vs rating and popularity vs rating

---------------------------------
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Information
---------------------------------
Source: Synthetic dataset (inspired by MovieLens and IMDB)
Size: 35,000 records
Structure: Single-sheet Excel file
Key Columns:
- User Info: user_id, age, gender, occupation, income, device, location
- Movie Info: movie_id, title, release_year, genres, director, duration_min, budget, box_office, language, country
- Ratings Info: rating, timestamp, watch_time, user_sentiment, review_text
- Derived Metrics: popularity_index, rating_zscore, avg_genre_rating, activity_level, revenue_ratio, cold_start_flag

Data Types:
- Categorical: gender, occupation, genres, director, country
- Numerical: rating, duration_min, budget, box_office, income, age
- Date/Time: timestamp, release_year

---------------------------------
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning Steps
---------------------------------
Performed or to be performed:
- Handling missing values using imputation (mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Correcting incorrect data types (e.g., timestamp ‚Üí datetime)
- Removing duplicate entries (especially on user_id + movie_id)
- Treating outliers using IQR or z-score methods
- Standardizing text (lowercase genres, removing whitespace)
- Parsing multi-genre fields into separate rows or columns for analysis

---------------------------------
4Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics
---------------------------------
Compute and interpret:
- Mean, median, mode, standard deviation of ratings
- Distribution of ratings by user, movie, and genre
- Frequency counts of categorical features (top directors, languages, countries)
- Skewness and kurtosis of numeric columns

---------------------------------
5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizations
---------------------------------
Suggested Plots:
- Histograms ‚Üí Rating distributions, Age, Duration, Budget
- Boxplots ‚Üí Rating by Genre, Rating by Gender, Rating by Occupation
- Violin Plots ‚Üí Genre x Year average rating
- Heatmaps ‚Üí Correlations, Genre vs Year avg rating
- Scatterplots ‚Üí Popularity vs Rating, Budget vs Box Office
- Countplots ‚Üí Genre frequency, Country representation
- Long-tail plots ‚Üí Active users and popular movies

---------------------------------
6Ô∏è‚É£ Relationships Explored
---------------------------------
Investigate:
- Correlation between release year and rating
- Genre vs average rating using ANOVA
- User occupation vs rating preference
- Gender bias in ratings
- Recency (watch time) vs rating
- Cold-start effects (new users/movies)

---------------------------------
7Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insights
---------------------------------
Expected patterns:
- Popular genres may not always have the highest ratings
- Older movies might receive lower ratings due to recency bias
- Active users tend to have a narrower rating variance
- Certain occupations may exhibit consistent preferences

---------------------------------
8Ô∏è‚É£ Planned Steps
---------------------------------
Next phases:
- Feature engineering (e.g., avg_user_rating, normalized_popularity)
- Hypothesis testing (ANOVA, Chi-Square, correlation)
- Build predictive models (rating prediction, user clustering)
- Time-based analysis (temporal drift in genre ratings)

---------------------------------
9Ô∏è‚É£ Assumptions and Notes
---------------------------------
- The dataset represents realistic but synthetic data
- Assumes each user-movie pair appears once
- No missing critical identifiers (user_id, movie_id)
- Ratings are on a 1‚Äì5 scale
- Multi-genre movies appear as comma-separated values

---------------------------------
üîü Tools and Code
---------------------------------
Recommended Libraries:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy.stats for ANOVA and correlation
- sklearn.preprocessing for scaling
- wordcloud for text visualization
- plotly or seaborn for interactive visualizations

Code Examples:
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_excel("MovieMaster_EDA_Full_35k.xlsx")
sns.boxplot(x="genres", y="rating", data=df)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()
