# IMDB-Rating
An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of IMDb movie ratings to uncover patterns in genres, languages, production companies, and audience preferences using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries.
This project focuses on understanding the trends, correlations, and patterns within IMDb movie data.
Through detailed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, it highlights what contributes most to a film’s success among critics and audiences.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the distribution of IMDb ratings

Study relationships between genres, languages, and scores

Compare critic ratings vs audience ratings

Identify which production companies and countries consistently perform better

Explore revenue ratios and their relationship with IMDb scores

🧠 Key Insights (Example)

Certain genres like Drama and Thriller dominate higher ratings.

Movies produced in English tend to have broader rating distributions.

Critic scores and IMDb scores are strongly correlated.

High-grossing movies don’t always receive higher ratings.
